<h1> Here and There 
    </h1>
    <br>
<h2>
    'Here'
    </h2>
<p>
   Soft benediction of September sun;
    <br>
    Voices of children, laughing as they run;
    <br>
    Green English lawns, bright flowers and butterflies;
    <br>
    And over all the blue embracing skies.
    </p>
    <br>
<h3>
    'There'
    </h3>
<p>
    Tumult and roaring of the incessant gun;
    <br>
    Dead men and dying, trenches lost and won;
    <br>
    Blood, mud, and havoc, bugles, shoutings, cries;
    <br>
    And over all the blue embracing skies
    </p>
    <br>
